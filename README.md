# AFVsimulationCode

We implement RSQE and HQE simulation schemes from the paper Efficient simulation of affine forward volatility models available at: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3322085.

We also provide an easy-to-follow Jupyter notebook that shows how to use these schemes, in particular to generate volatility smiles.
